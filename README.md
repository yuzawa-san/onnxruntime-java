# onnxruntime-java

This is an **experimental** Java binding to Microsoft's [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime).

This uses Java's Panama project. Given the incubating status of that project, this library should be considered a proof of concept and lacks the stability guarantees.
